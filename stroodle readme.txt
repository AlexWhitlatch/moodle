Thank you for your interest in the Stroodle development team. Below you will find the valuable information
needed to get started working on our product and pick up where we left off.



Vision Statement:
In MSU Denver the Computer Science capstone course "Software Engineering Practices" has a single semester long project: to improve upon
a free, open source project. The goal is to apply the agile principles and team based learning from the previous semester into a bigger,
 more cohesive project to benefit a real life organization. The hope is that once this project is over, we will have gained an understanding 
of how software projects are tackled, from setting up a management system to manage artifacts and our process, to properly presenting our 
findings to our stakeholders and to our peers.



Mission Statement:
Moodle is a free open source learning platform used by teachers and students around the world to create a personalized learning environment. 
Many courses in our own Metropolitan State University of Denver use it as the primary source of providing resources and submitting assignments, 
thus all of us working on this project have experience using it.
Our 4 person team plans to improve the desktop version of Moodle in any way we are able, either by fixing a bug(s), adding a useful feature or 
improving some functionality. Using Moodle's issue tracker and communicating with their large and diverse community, we will find something to 
work on that both challenges and excites us. Slack is the main form of communication, Toggl will track time and Trello will host our development 
process. As for the development process we plan to use, we have settled on Scrum, a popular Agile methodology we have used before.
